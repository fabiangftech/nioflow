# Overview

nio-flow lets you model a processing flow as a **chain of stages declared once**. Every value you inject walks the chain independently: several values are in flight at the same time, a value blocked on slow IO never delays the values behind it, and an error short-circuits only the value that failed.

Every stage is one of two kinds — and that's the heart of the API: **`handle` runs synchronously, `submit` runs asynchronously**. Both take a `Function<T, T>` and both can do IO (JDBC, HTTP, ...). Under the hood the engine keeps a **submission queue** of values ready for their next stage and a **completion queue** of reaped async results: a boss event loop hands each value to a virtual-thread handle worker, and `submit` stages run on an executor without the engine waiting.

```java
import dev.nioflow.application.facade.DefaultNioFlow;

try (NioFlow<Order> flow = new DefaultNioFlow<>()) {
    flow.handle("validate", orders::validate)
        .submit("enrich", api::enrich)                 // async stage — never blocks other values
        .when(order -> order.priority())
        .then(lane -> lane
                .submit(order -> notifier.push(order)))
        .otherwise(lane -> lane
                .handle(order -> queue.offer(order)))
        .onErrorResume(error -> Order.rejected(error))
        .seal();

    flow.justAll(orders);
    flow.join();
}
```

## Installation

**Gradle**

```groovy
implementation 'dev.nioflow:core:1.0.0'
```

**Maven**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.nioflow</groupId>
    <artifactId>core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Requires **Java 25+** (virtual threads and scoped values). The core has **zero runtime dependencies** — Resilience4j and OpenTelemetry integrations are optional and only activate when you add those libraries yourself. See the [quick start](quickstart.md) for details.

## Why nio-flow?

- **Multiple values in flight** — the chain is declared once; every injected value walks it concurrently with its own cursor.
- **Sync or async, per stage** — `handle` runs synchronously on a handle worker; `submit` runs asynchronously on your executor and is reaped later. Both can do IO: a value stuck on JDBC or HTTP never holds up the rest.
- **Virtual threads by default** — blocking anywhere ties up only that value, not a shared worker.
- **Per-value error isolation** — a failure short-circuits one value, is delivered to `onError`, and can be recovered in place with `onErrorResume`.
- **Rich flow shapes** — two-way forks (`when`), switch-style forks (`match`), filtering, fan-out, type adaptation and reusable segments (`via`).
- **Request/response built in** — `call` injects one value and returns a `CompletableFuture` with *that value's own* result: the natural fit for web handlers sharing one long-lived flow, no bridge class needed.
- **Editable at runtime** — `remove`/`replace`/`insertBefore`/`insertAfter` swap whole segments of the chain while values are in flight; each value finishes on the version it entered (copy-on-write).
- **Scoped flows** — `scoped()` gives each caller an ephemeral private chain over the same engine: one shared (even empty) flow serves many call sites, and their stages never interfere.
- **Bulk IO built in** — `batch` groups values by size or age and runs one async call for the whole group, with per-value recovery.
- **Backpressure** — bound the number of values in flight and choose to block, drop or fail at capacity.
- **Observability first** — a metrics port (with an OpenTelemetry adapter), an opt-in per-value tracer, and a one-line diagnostics dump of the running flow.
- **Zero required dependencies** — the core is plain JDK; adapters are `compileOnly` and opt-in.
